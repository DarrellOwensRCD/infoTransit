The Census 2010 to 2020 comparison map was created with an alogrithm which was able to compare two types of Census Tracts:
1) Tracts with identical numbers from 2010 to 2020. Both whole and decimal tracts. For example: Tract 4220 (2010) -> Tract 4220 (2020)
2) Tracts that were whole numbers in 2010 but split in 2020. For example: Tract 4220 (2010) -> Tract 4220.01, Tract 4220.02 (2020)

The program was unable to compare tracts which lacked numerical consistency, which were 2010 decimal tracts split four ways. 
For example: Tract 330.01 , Tract 330.02 may both get split and become 330.03, 330.04, 330.05, 330.06. Lack of consistency about which decimal tracts split in which ways resulted in tracts being N/A. 
Program was unable to compare tracts that had complete reclassifications based on the Census's definition of abnormal tracts. For example, university tract 4227 reclassified to 9000 series.

These tracts will be updated soon but require manual review.
